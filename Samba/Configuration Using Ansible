Let us see the workflow to Automate Samba configuration using Ansible.

1. Inventory : 
---------------	
	Define the target hosts(s) in the Ansible inventory.

2. create playbooks for the following tasks:
---------------------------------------------
Tasks:

Install Samba Packages: 
	Install samba and samba-common using the appropriate package manager module 

Configure smb.conf: 
	Use the template module to deploy a Jinja2 template of the smb.conf file, allowing for dynamic configuration of global settings and shares based on variables.


Manage Samba Users: 
	Create or modify Samba user passwords using the command module with pdbedit.


Manage Share Directories: 
	Create the directories to be shared using the file module, ensuring correct permissions and ownership.

Start and Enable Samba Services: 
	Use the service module to ensure smbd and nmbd services are running and start on boot.


(Optional) Configure Firewall: 
	Open necessary ports (TCP ports 139 and 445, UDP ports 137 and 138) using modules like firewalld or ufw.

3. Defining Variables:
-----------------------

Variable Definition: Define Samba-related configuration parameters as Ansible variables (e.g., workgroup, security mode, share definitions, user credentials). These can be in the playbook, separate variable files, or inventory.


4. Playbook Execution:
--------------------

 Run the Ansible playbook against the target server(s) using ansible-playbook.

5. Verification: 
-----------------

Include tasks to check the status of Samba services and potentially test share access from a Windows client (this might require additional scripting).


----------------------------------
Best Practices
----------------------------------
Some of the Best Practices for Configuring Samba with Ansible  are listed as follows. 

1. Leverage Jinja2 Templates: 
-----------------------------
For smb.conf to manage the configuration file dynamically based on variables.


2. Centralize Share Definitions: 
--------------------------------
Define your Samba shares as a list of dictionaries in Ansible variables. This makes it easy to add, modify, or remove shares.

3. Modular Roles:
-----------------
Organize Samba configuration tasks into Ansible roles (e.g., samba-install, samba-config, samba-shares, samba-users, samba-service).

4. Idempotency: 
----------------
Ensure your Ansible tasks are idempotent, so repeated runs don't cause unintended changes. For example, when creating Samba users, check if they already exist.


5. Directory Management: 
-------------------------
Use the file module to create shared directories and set appropriate ownership and permissions.


6. Samba User Management:
------------------------- 
Use the command module with pdbedit to manage Samba users. Consider using creates or removes options to ensure idempotency. For more complex user management, explore modules like user in conjunction with command.
